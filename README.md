# Introduction to Databases with MySQL

This is a collection of assignments and exercises that were developed for an introduction to databases course at Mount Royal University.

Each folder contains .sql files and .log files
                - .sql files contain MySQL scripts
                - .log files contain the results of running those scripts

Using MySql formed queries, created/dropped tables, inserted/removed data, and created procedures and triggers.

The assignments and exercises increase compelxity as the numbers increase with a4 using the most complex commands.
